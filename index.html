      <p>My name is Mayu and I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I moved to Miami five years ago to attend to study
        Criminology at the University of Miami.
      </p>
      <p>I currently live in Brickell with my best friend, Martha, and our two pets. We have a pomeranian named Logan and a
        cat named Lucy.

      </p>
      <p>I am currently working at Apple in the Genius Bar where I offer customers technical support for their devices. </p>
      <p>I am learning how to code in order to further my career with the company and eventually land a corporate position as
        a software developer.</p>
